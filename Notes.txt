TODO:

Straighten out tetras:
    - Get rid of warnings about normal pointing into shape, faces should have
        vertices ordered CCW
    - Consolidate tetras into as few convex polygons as can be done. Maybe do this
        based on the cuboids and prisms?

    - Add spars rigid bodies, handling of tetra volumes for those.

Figure out why collisions with buoys isn't working.
