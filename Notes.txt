TODO:

- Add spars rigid bodies, handling of tetra volumes for those.
    Need to track shifting child rigid bodies, but only when they change.
    - Vessel:
        - MainMast
        - MainBoom
            Change would typically be rotation of boom
        - Rudder
            Change would typically be rotation of rudder.
            Do we need to track this?
    
    The way the Cannon body stuff currently works is that we take the volumes
    of a rigid body and then:
        - Clone the vertices.
        - Generate a CANNON.ConvexPolyhedron() for each volume
        - Update the body center of mass from all the shapes (this is dependent on the individual volumes)

    So, want to be able to update the vertices of the shape associated with a given volume,
    but only if the volume has moved or changed shape.
    More than anything, don't want to have to create new shapes.

Lateral hull resistance > longitudinal hull resistance
Hull windage

Add drawing of sail

Rotate world:
    Option to rotate world, rotate boat
    Ability to shift center of view, re-center.

Draggable controls:

Projected 3D drawing.

Add alternate plane projection for resultants that are too close to the desired plane.

Add wake sprites

Add optional traveled path (i.e. long wake)

Add wind puffs on water.

Animate water

Wind manager

Sailing boundaries

Zoom?



Much Later:
Boat designer:
Lets you change different parameters of the boat.
